# FastAgent Migration Plan: Python to Go

## Incremental Development Approach

Each phase below represents a complete, testable milestone. We'll only move to the next phase once the current one is fully functional and well-tested.

### Phase 1: Core Configuration (In Progress)
Goal: Basic configuration loading and validation

- [x] Basic Settings Structure
  - [x] Create core settings structs
  - [x] Implement YAML loading
  - [x] Add environment variable support
  - [x] Write tests for config loading
  - [x] Add validation for required fields
  
Testable Outcomes:
- [x] Can load `fastagent.config.yaml`
- [x] Can override with environment variables
- [x] Validates configuration correctness
- [x] CLI can display current configuration

### Phase 2: Basic Context & Logging (Next Up)
Goal: Establish foundational context management and logging

- [ ] Simple Context Management
  - [ ] Create base context struct
  - [ ] Implement context initialization
  - [ ] Add basic cleanup handling
  
- [ ] Basic Logging
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] Add log levels
  - [ ] Create console output formatting
  
Testable Outcomes:
- [ ] Can initialize and cleanup application context
- [ ] Logs are properly formatted and leveled
- [ ] Context carries configuration through the app

### Phase 3: MCP Server - Single Transport
Goal: Implement basic MCP server support with stdio transport

- [ ] Server Configuration
  - [ ] Define server settings struct
  - [ ] Implement stdio transport
  - [ ] Add basic server lifecycle

- [ ] Server Registry
  - [ ] Create registry interface
  - [ ] Add server registration
  - [ ] Implement basic connection management

Testable Outcomes:
- Can configure a simple MCP server
- Can establish stdio connections
- Basic server lifecycle works

### Phase 4: Basic Workflow Support
Goal: Simple workflow execution capability

- [ ] Workflow Structure
  - [ ] Define workflow interfaces
  - [ ] Create basic workflow registry
  - [ ] Implement simple execution

- [ ] Task Management
  - [ ] Add task registration
  - [ ] Implement basic task execution
  - [ ] Add error handling

Testable Outcomes:
- Can define simple workflows
- Can execute basic tasks
- Proper error handling in place

### Future Phases (To Be Detailed Later)
- Enhanced MCP Server Support (additional transports)
- Advanced Workflow Features
- Human Input & Progress Display
- Telemetry & Monitoring
- Additional Model Providers

## Testing Strategy

Each phase will include:
1. Unit tests for new functionality
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. Example code demonstrating usage
4. Documentation updates

## Current Progress

### Completed
- [x] Basic CLI structure
- [x] Initial command implementation
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Basic config command
- [x] Configuration loading and validation
- [x] Environment variable support
- [x] Configuration tests

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 2: Basic Context & Logging setup

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementing the context package
2. Set up basic logging infrastructure
3. Add context-aware configuration handling
4. Write context and logging tests

## Development Guidelines

1. **Incremental Progress**
   - Each change should be small and testable
   - Keep changes focused and atomic
   - Maintain working state at all times

2. **Testing First**
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Ensure all changes are covered by tests
   - Include examples in tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Update docs with each change
   - Include usage examples
   - Keep migration plan current

4. **Review Points**
   - Review progress after each phase
   - Adjust plan based on learnings
   - Ensure maintainable code structure

## Questions & Decisions

Document key decisions and questions as we progress:

1. Configuration Structure
   - ✓ Nested configurations handled through struct embedding
   - ✓ Environment variables use FASTAGENT_ prefix with structured naming
   - ✓ Validation implemented with specific error messages

2. Context Management (Next Focus)
   - How to handle global state?
   - Context cancellation patterns?
   - Resource cleanup approach?
